    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of environmental swipe samples involves the so-called particle analysis, where individual particles collected during sampling are analyzed with micro analytical methods. Here, mass spectrometric analysis of uranium isotopic compositions has become a routine technique applied for the verification and monitoring of nuclear safeguards agreements. The International Atomic Energy Agency undertakes the particle analysis of safeguards samples within a Network of Analytical Laboratories (NWAL) of accredited laboratories.  \n",
    "Dedicated test samples are used for the purpose of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA). To this end a particle production process was developed, established and characterized to deliver uranium micro particles. Such particle QC materials are used as a base material to design QC test samples for calibration, internal QC, external QC or interlaboratory comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particle production setup delivers monodisperse uranium oxide particles $U_{3}O_{8}$ of isotopic composition determined by the input feed material. Two production test runs were performed, the first using input feed solution prepared from IRMM-183 (depleted uranium) and a second prepared from IRMM-023 (low-enriched uranium). Particles had been deposited on flat and polished glass carbon substrates (GC planchets) which is the substrate of choice for highly sensitive analytical methods. The substrates had been tested by the IAEA using LG-SIMS mass spectrometry which lead to following findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* On particles produced in the second run (LEU), the LG-SIMS analysis of planchets detected uranium signals with a differing isotopic composition (DU). It is presumed that these traces result from previous production runs. The signals are detected on a localized area (circular pattern). There are traces of uranium detected by LG-SIMS with a low count rate of DU. These signals represent a background contribution of uranium traces which, however, do not stem from the actual mono disperse particles. Instead, the background contribution appears is attributed to highly minute deposits, which are only detectable using the highly sensitive LG-SIMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The direct deposition of particles on the the GC planchet using an inertial impactor was used in the production test runs. This leads to a spatial particle deposition pattern. The particle loading density varies with the radial distance from the center of the deposition pattern. It would be desirable to have the particles homogeneously distributed over the particle substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each substrate was deposited over a duration of several minutes, and a series of ca. 50 substrates was loaded with particles with the interial impaction technique. The direct deposition is considered to be not sufficiently homogeneous in between substrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings led to the development of following mitigation strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The 'memory effect', i.e. the deposit of uranium traces from previous production runs, is mitigated by undertaking cleaning and replacement of parts of the system prior to each production run for a selected isotopic composition of the input feed solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An alternative deposition technique by deposition of particles is tested. Particles are produced and collected on a substrate. The collected particles and then transfered into a solution which is then applied onto flat substrates and dried. This deposition technique allows for a better control of particle density and also permits the preparation of particle mixtures. As an additional advantage, the particle deposition is perfomed as a subsequent step to particle production which allows for a better control of the deposition process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report describes the particle producation and preparation of test substrates performed in the first quarter of 2017 and the results from in-house characterization using the scanning electron microscope."

    "During the particle production run, a particle suspension was prepared from particles collected onto a 1\" Si-substrate. Particle deposits were clearly visible through visual inspection by eye. The substrate was immersed in XX ml high purity grade ethanol for XX minutes. Then a first test was made using Si-wafer specimens  in which different amounts of the suspension was dried on the surface. The substrates are in a glass beaker on a hotplate set to 50 °C heating temperature. The tests allow to determine the amount of suspension which needs to be dried on the surface to reach sufficient particle density. After the initial tests, XX ml of particle suspension was applied onto a GC planchet which was slowly dried while adding the suspension onto the surface with a pipette."

    "Three marks were scribed onto the surface of the GC planchets to provide reference coordinates which can be used to reference the particle locations. These markes form a triangle and are positioned around the centre of the circular planchet. When the inertial impactor is used particles are deposited onto a circle of ca. 12 mm in diameter and the markers are arranged at a circle slightly larger than the 12 mm diameter such that particles are not deposited onto the markers. The markings are made in the shapes of a 'I', 'T' and 'X' such that they can be distiguished from each other when visually inspecting the substrate.\n",

    "Prior to initiating the particle search programme, images of the markers were recorded with the SEM. Operation paramters of the SEM are stored in the footer of the images in plain-text. In the footer the coordinates of the stage holder can be extracted. As the stage coordinates are also used by the particle search routine to determine the particle location, the marker locations can be determined from the images and the stage location. As the markings are fairly large when viewed at the the high-magnification of the SEM, a reference point was annotated in the images which is used to express the location in SEM sample stage coordinates. \n",

This way, large particles and agglomerates can be easily spotted in the overview.\n",
    "The top-left diagram is interactive and by selecting the according tool at the toolbar at the right-hand side allows to zoom in or to select  group of particles (box- or lasso-select tool). The top-right shows an overview of the planchet at the zoom window selected on the top-left plot is shown in the diagramm. The marker locations are indicated by violett crosses and on the top-right plot the marker shape and coordinates are displayed when the mouse arrow hovers above the marker cross. The bottom plot shows a scatter plot of the uranium content as determined by EDX vs. the Average Diameter determined from the particle search.\n",

This feature allows to search the particles with specific features, e.g. by selecting particles with a specific diameter.

Images were recorded using the backscatter and the secondary electron detector at magnification 150 and 600. In the BS images uranium particles are visible as high-Z materials have a higher contrast in this imaging mode. The residues become visible after adjusting the brightness of the image in the BS mode and more clearly in the SE imaging mode. In addition two spot EDX measurements were performed to determine the elemental composition of the residue material. The EDX-spectra of the two spots taken at locations of visible residue show the presence of elements C, O, Si, Al and F.\n",
